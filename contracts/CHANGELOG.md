Every contract change, dated, with the reason. Newest first.

## 2026-08-06 — Health Scan contract published (Dev B)

Initial publication of `healthscan-api.md`, `healthscan.schema.json`, `healthscan.d.ts`,
`samples/hosts-response.json`, `samples/findings-response.json`.

Closes the Day-1 gate for the Dev B → Dev C contract (issues #1, #2). Answers all nine of Dev C's
schema questions inline in §4 of `healthscan-api.md`.

Follows §5 of the MVP doc exactly — no fields added or removed. Three deviations from what the
MVP doc *implies*, all forced by what live IRIS actually emits:

- **`status` has no `Warning`.** The real enum, read from IRIS source, is `OK`, `Error`,
  `Inactive`, `Retry`, `Stopped`, `Unconfigured`, plus `Disabled` from `EnumerateHostStatus`.
  This is the one answer that contradicts a Dev C assumption — the `HostStatus` union needs
  `Warning` removed. Existing code still degrades correctly because unknown statuses already
  render neutral.
- **`type` is normalized.** IRIS reports business processes as `actor`. We map
  `actor → process` so the contract keeps the MVP doc's vocabulary.
- **`avgProcessingTime` / `avgQueueingTime` are aggregates.** IRIS emits these per
  `(host, messagetype)`, so one host has several series. We collapse them to one number,
  weighted by `iris_interop_sample_count`.

Units confirmed empirically rather than assumed: Cloud API configured at 0.05s latency reports
`avgProcessingTime: 0.05`. Seconds, as Dev C assumed.

Samples carry real measured values from the LABDEMO production, including a genuinely induced
degraded state (Cloud API disabled → queue depth 48), not invented numbers.

### Known gap, not a contract change

`iris_interop_queued` carries no `host` label — it emits once per production. Per-host queue depth
is available from `Ens.Util.Statistics:EnumerateHostStatus` (verified: `Cloud API = 48` while
disabled), so `Host.queued` stays a required number. **This needs Dev A's proxy to read host
status, not only the Prometheus metrics text.** Raised with Dev A separately; no contract impact
if that holds.
